# encrypto_sample
A small sample showing encryption and hashing in an Android app. Feel free to be inspired and feel free to credit me as much or little as you want.

It is only for demonstration purposes and uses the very nice library java-aes-crypto by @tozny for symmetric encryption.

The salting is obviously faulty and if you want to use any of this as inspiration for a real world app, fix it.
